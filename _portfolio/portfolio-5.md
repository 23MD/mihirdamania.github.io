## Description
This project involves building a web application that predicts a student's math performance based on several features using the best-performing regression model. The objective is to understand and implement the end-to-end machine learning development life cycle on a simple problem.

### Web Application
You can access the web app [here](https://student-exam-performance-indicator.onrender.com/predictdata).
