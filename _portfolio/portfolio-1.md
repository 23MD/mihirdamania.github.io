# Introduction
This project aims to analyze the economic growth of Telangana from FY2019 to FY2022 and visualize it through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The analysis focuses on three key areas: stamp duty registration revenue, vehicle sales, and direct investment under the TS-iPASS scheme, with a district-wise breakdown.

The higher-level questions guiding this analysis include:

- What changes occurred after the introduction of e-stamp challan in stamp duty registration?
- What trends are evident in vehicle sales, and how are they distributed across districts?
- How is the regional distribution of investment segmented by sectors?
- Is there a correlation between direct investment, vehicle sales, and registration revenue?

By addressing these questions, this project provides a comprehensive view of Telangana’s growth across these domains.

# About Telangana
Telangana became a state on June 2, 2014, after separating from the northwestern region of united Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as its capital. From December 2018 to November 2023, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) held power, led by Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) in his second term.

Telangana's economy ranks as the ninth-largest in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹9.57 trillion (US$130 billion) in 2023 and a per capita GSDP of ₹320,000 (US$3,800). In 2022-2023, the state generated ₹1.07 trillion in state-owned tax revenue (SOTR).
